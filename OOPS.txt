                          OOPS

OOP-object oriented programming.

Object- Instance of Class
Class- Template for objects
funcions in classes are called methods.

OOP Principals
---------------
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymorphism
---------------

*Encapsulation:
grouping data with method in a class( reason: prevennt direct access from outside)

Acccess through method: Getter(retrieve info),Setter(modify info with permission)

*Abstraction:
only show essential details. hide all other details.
Function or method overloading
how abstraction done?

Interface                            Implementation
(shown outside class)              (hidden from outside)

*Inheritance:
Allows classes to use data from another class.(used in class within a class)
sub class inherits from super class.
Access modifiers- changes where class data can be accessed from
1)public- all sub classes can use it
2)private-sub classes cannot use it
3)protected- choosen classes can use it

*Polymorphism:
Ability of methods to take more than one form
1)Dynamic- Occurs during runtime. both superclass & sub class have ssame method
2)Static- occurs during compile time. many methods with same name and diff arguments
